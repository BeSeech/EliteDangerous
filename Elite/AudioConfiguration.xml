		This file gives you the option to overwrite Elite's internal settings for the audio engine Wwise on Windows systems. 
		Please note that the game will sanity check all supplied values and fall back to defaults in the case of invalid data.
		
		1. Latency:
			The numbers RefillBuffers and SamplesPerFrame under "Latency" define the internal latency and thus the frame rate of the audio engine. 
			A rule of thumb here is that lower values mean LESS latency and therefore a FASTER frame rate.
			Lowering the numbers here might be desirable e.g. when you want to get audio frame rate closer to the target frame rate of VR headsets (90fps, ~11ms).
			However be aware that this will also increase the CPU impact and you might experience audio dropouts if the numbers are too low. 
			
			RefillBuffers: 		default is 4, valid numbers are 1 to 8.
			SamplesPerFrame:	default is 1024, valid entries are 256, 512, 1024 and 2048
			
			For more info check: https://www.audiokinetic.com/library/2015.1.5_5533/?source=SDK&id=soundengine__events.html (Latency Between Posting an Event and Actual Sound Playback)		
			
			Feel free to experiment with those numbers and maybe let us know via the forums how they work out for you.
			
		2. AudioAPI:
			This setting allows you to overwrite the used Audio API on Windows systems. These are defaults:
			- If you start the game within a VR environment (Oculus Store or the Steam VR build) it will use WASAPI.
			- If you start the game within Steam (non VR) or via Elite launcher either WASAPI or XAudio2 may be chosen (it is Wwise's choice and depends on the used operating system).
			
			Changing this might be useful if you experience Elite taking exclusive ownership about Windows' audio environment or silent Oculus Rift headphones.
			The values mean:
			0 - no change, the default AudioAPI will be used (see above)
			1 - force WASAPI
			2 - force XAudio2
