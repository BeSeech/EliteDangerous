After recently discovering that I could change the color of my HUD from a thread I read about here on the forums I decided to see if there was any way to change the in game Fov.
The setting files is found at: C:\Users\(Username)\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Graphics\Settings.xml

It seems that the default ingame slider maxes out at 60. I play at 1920x1080@60hz on a 24" monitor +TrackIR and setting it to 80 suits me best.
Changing it really helped get rid of the super cramped feeling from inside the cockpit, It feels much more open and enjoyable now.
